This is the stuff installed on the astrowebservices.com server to support the configuration
of the Sidereal Watchface Pebble watch face.

In the www directory is the web page and JS presented to the user when they ask for the
configuration. It requires the normal Slate CSS, JS and fonts in the directory; this is not
included here since no alterations to the Slate package are required. The configuration JS
requires Dojo 1.10 to be available and configured properly for AMD.

In the cgi directory is the Perl CGI script that queries for the location that the user
supplies and returns the longitudes. The .bz2 file is the list of locations that it will
search, but it needs to be decompressed before the script can use it.
